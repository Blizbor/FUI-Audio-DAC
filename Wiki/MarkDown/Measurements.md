# Measurements

## 1. Remote
### 1.1 Power Requirements

These measurements were performed without the RF-link, at `Vcc` = 5&nbsp;V:

- The stand-by current is 40&nbsp;&micro;A
- While sending data, the supply current is 6.35&nbsp;mA.

These measurements were performed with the RF-link, at `Vcc` = 5&nbsp;V:

- The stand-by current is 40&nbsp;&micro;A
- While sending data, the supply current is 11.7&nbsp;mA.

Assuming that the battery capacity is 1&nbsp;Ah, as is typical for alkaline AAA batteries, this would imply a stand-by life-time of about 2&nbsp;years.
